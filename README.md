# Mastodon Action Test
This is just a test if GitHub actions can make Mastodon post for use in Jekyll blogs to add Mastodon comments to them and such.

This is to detect new posts and post them to Mastodon and save the id in a csv file since that is the most convenient format for this due to appendability.

Feel free to do what you want with this.
